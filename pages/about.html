        Peaky Blinders is a British period crime drama television series created
        by Steven Knight. Set in Birmingham, England, the series follows the
        exploits of the Shelby crime family in the direct aftermath of the First
        World War. The fictional family is loosely based on a real urban youth
        gang of the same name, who were active in the city from the 1890s to the
        early 20th century. Peaky Blinders features an ensemble cast, led by
        Cillian Murphy, Helen McCrory, Joe Cole, and Paul Anderson starring as
        Tommy Shelby, Elizabeth "Polly" Gray, John Shelby and Arthur Shelby
        respectively, the gang's senior members. Sam Neill, Tom Hardy, Paddy
        Considine, Adrien Brody, Aidan Gillen, Charlotte Riley, Sam Claflin and
        Anya Taylor-Joy also have recurring roles at various junctures of the
        series. The show premiered on 12 September 2013, telecast on BBC Two
        until the fourth series, and then shifted to BBC One for the fifth and
        upcoming sixth series. In 2018, after the show's Drama Series win at the
        BAFTA TV Awards, Knight confirmed his "ambition of making it a story of
        a family between two wars, and by ending it with the first air raid
        siren in Birmingham", which was 25 June 1940. The fifth series premiered
        on BBC One on 25 August 2019 and finished on 22 September 2019. Netflix,
        under the deal with Weinstein Company and Endemol, had acquired the
        rights to release Peaky Blinders in the United States and around the
        world. In January 2021, it was announced that the sixth series would be
        the final series of Peaky Blinders.

      <p class="about-etimology">
        The popular origin of the name Peaky Blinder is said to be derived from
        the gang members' practice of stitching disposable razor blades into the
        peaks of their flat caps which could then be used as weapons. However,
        as the Gillette company only introduced the first replaceable safety
        razor system in 1903, in America, and it was not until 1908 that the
        first factory manufacturing them in Great Britain opened, this version
        of the name is considered apocryphal. British author John Douglas, from
        Birmingham, claimed hats were used as a weapon in his novel A Walk Down
        Summer Lane â€“ members with razor blades sewn into their caps would
        headbutt enemies to potentially blind them, or the caps would be used to
        slash foreheads, causing blood to pour down into the eyes of their
        enemies, temporarily blinding them. Birmingham historian Carl Chinn
        believes the name is actually a reference to the gang's sartorial
        elegance. He says the popular usage of "peaky" at the time referred to
        any flat cap with a peak. "Blinder" was a familiar Birmingham slang term
        (still used today) to describe something or someone of dapper
        appearance. A further explanation might be from the gang's own criminal
        behaviour: they were known to sneak up from behind, then pull the hat
        peak down over a victim's face so they could not describe who robbed
        them.
