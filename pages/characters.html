              entrepreneur, legitimate bookmaker, captain of industry, and now

              business thrive. Is Shelby an arch-capitalist, or does anything
              remain of the old Tommy, the man who set off to war fifteen-odd
              years ago, who was funny, good with horses, who cared about
              things, who even believed in the communist cause?

              Captain Swing is a formidable, calculating and precise leader who
              will give the Peaky Blinders pause when it comes to any dealings
              with her.<br />Tommy Shelby respects her message and warning, and
              comes to know her to be a woman of her word.
